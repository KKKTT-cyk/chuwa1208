1. Class is the blueprint like a car design and object is the real thing created from that blueprint like a car read to rev.

2. Compiler wont create a default no-params constructor. You have to explicitly create one.

3.Privite, Default, Protected, Public

4.Method overloading is methods with same name but different params number or type.
Method overriding is subclass implement parent's method in a different way.

5.No. Final is immutable and priviate is visible only to parent class.

6.Static polymorphism is method overlaoding within the same class and happens during compile time that checks reference type, mainly for readability.
Dynamic polymorphism is method overriding, the core of OOP, happens in inheritance during runtime that checks object type.

7.Parents classes may have multiple method with same name and when diamond inherited subclass is confused. 
Use interface instead.

8.At compile time, static polymorphism, lst is reference to List;
At runtime, dynamic polymorphism, lst is of object type ArratList.
