1.Error, CheckedException, UncheckedException
(1) No; Yes; No
(2) OOM; SQLException; NullPointerException
(3) Add JVM args; Catch or Throw; Carefully prevent (check all sub level for null pointer object)

2. First run try block, if no exception, go to finally block; If exception, jump right away to catch block, then finally block.
Finally will be returned. Finally almost always runs so its returned value would overwrite try block and catch block. Upstream caller would only see finally's returned value.

3. For multiple catch blocks case, earlier catch's exception must be subclass of later's.
OrderNotFoundException extends Exception so it is the subclass.
Otherwise the large catch block will always run and completely ignore the small ones. 

4.(1) throw is used inside a method body while throws is used in a method signature;
(2) throws + exception class names
    throw + exception object;
(3) public void getOrder(String orderId) throws OrderNotFoundException, DBException, Exception {
        throw new OrderNotFoundException();
    }

5.try-with-resources automatically release resources when the block finishes without finally block.
java.lang.AutoCloseable
LIFO order

6.CheckedException extends Exception while UncheckedException extends RuntimeException
For Exception, OrderNotFoundException extends Exception, programm may still succeed if the caller reacts properly (ask user to input another orderId);
FOr RuntimeException, IllegalArgumentException("Order Id must be positive"), this should never happen if the programm is correct.

7..values() is a static method to get an Array of all enum elements;
Each element is a new object, by calling enum class constructor;

enum ResultCode {
    SUCCESS(200, "Success"),
    NOTFOUND(404, "Not Found"),
    UNAHUTHORIZED(401, "Token expired"),
    FORBIDDEN(403, "Authentication failed");

    private long code;
    private String message;

    private ResultCode(long code, String message) {
        this.code = code;
        this.message = message;
    }
}

8.(1) Error code Interface defines a contract that all error enums must follow;
(2) Each module defines its own concrete error enums (multiple allowed);
(3) Base Business Exception
(4) Exception usage at application boundaries

polymorphism 

9.(1) List: Insertion order; Set: No order; Queue: FIFO;
(2) List: Allow duplicates; Set: No duplicates; Queue: Allow duplicates;
(3) ArrayList; HashSet; PriorityQueue;
(4) List: Index with random access, fast read; Set: De-duplication; Queue: task processing

10.HashMap is not thread-safe while Hashtable is thread-safe.
Hashtable uses coarse-grained sync, every operation locks the entire table, poor scalability;
Modern ConcurrentHashMap is better with fine-grained optimistic locking for high scalability.
