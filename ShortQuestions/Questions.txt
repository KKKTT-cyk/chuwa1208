Q: How to create a new thread(Please also consider Thread Pool approach)?
1. Simple Thread
Thread td = new Thread(() -> {});
td.start();

2. Using Thread Pool ExecutorService
ExecutorService executor = executor.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> {});
executor.shutdown();

Q: Difference between Runnable and Callable?
Runnable: A task returns no result. Cannot throw checked exceptions. Used with Thread or ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)
Callable: A task returns a result of type V. Can throw checked exceptions. Used with ExecutorService.submit(Callable<V>) and return a Future<V>

Q: What is the difference between t.start() and t.run()?
t.start(): starts a new thread and calls the run() method asynchronously.
t.run(): calls the run() method, no new thread is created.

Q: Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?
Using Runnable interface is better. Easier on tasks management and flexible to extend other class.

Q: What are the thread statuses?
NEW -> RUNNABLE -> BLOCKED -> WAITING -> TIMED_WAITING -> TERMINATED


Q: Demonstrate deadlock and how to resolve it in Java code.
DDL: Two threads are trying to lock two resources in opposite order. Thread 1 locks resource 1 waits for resource 2 while thread 2 locks resource 2 and waits for resouce 1.
Solution: Always acquire lock in the same order.

Q: How do threads communicate each other?
By sharing memory using methods such as wait(), notify(), notifyAll() on shared objects.


Q: What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?
Object Lock: locks an instance of a class.
Class Lock: locks the class object itself.



Q: What is join() method?
It makes the current thread wait until the target thread completes.

Q: what is yield() method
It pause the current thread.

Q: What is ThreadPool? How many types of ThreadPool? What is the TaskQueue in ThreadPool?
A ThreadPool is a collection of pre-created reusable threads.
There are:
1. newFixedThreadPool(int n)
2. newCachedThreadPool()
3. newSingleThreadExecutor()
4. newScheduledThreadPool(int n)

A TaskQueue is where submitted tasks wait when all threads in the pool are busy, it stores Runnable or Callable tasks until a thread becomes available.


Q: Which Library is used to create ThreadPool? Which Interface provide main functions of thread-pool?
java.util.concurrent package -> Executors and ThreadPoolExecutor class.
ExecutorService

Q: How to submit a task to ThreadPool?
We can use ExecutorService to submit tasks:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Hello")); // Runnable no result
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> 42); // Callable return result

Q: What is the advantage of ThreadPool?
1. Avoid frequent thread creation. 2. Limit the number of active threads. 3. Support queuing, scheduling, cancellation

Q: Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor
shutdown(): Stops accepting new tasks, lets submitted tasks finish
shutdownNow(): Attempts to stop all tasks immedeiatly, interrupts running threads, returns pending tasks.


Q: What is Atomic classes? 
Atomic classes allow multiple threads to update shared data without synchronized or locks.
It ensures the operations on single variables at the hardware level

Q: How many types of Atomic classes? Give me some code example of Atomic classes and its main methods. 
Q: when to use it?
1. Automic primitives. 2. Atomoic reference. 3. Atomic array. 4. Atomic field updaters.
Example:
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
counter.incrementAndGet(); // operations
counter.addAndGet(100);


Q: What is the concurrent collections? Can you list some concurrent data structure (Thread-safe)
Thread-saft data strutcures in java.util.concurrent package.
ConcurrentHashMap
ConcurrentLinkedQueue
ConcurrentSkipListSet

Q: What kind of locks do you know? What is the advantage of each lock?
1. Synchronized(obj) {}; // Simple, safe
2. Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); // Timeout support
3. ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(); // High read concurrency
4. StampedLock lock = new StampedLock(); // High throughput


Q: What is future and completableFuture? List some main methods of CompleteableFuture.
Future: the result of an asynchronous computation, return when a task is submitted to an ExecutorService;
CompletableFuture: New in Java 8, support asynchronous programming, allows chaining, combining, and callback-style execution

Some methods:
supplyAsync(Supplier<T>)
runAsync(Runnable)
allOf()
anyOf()
complete()
join()
