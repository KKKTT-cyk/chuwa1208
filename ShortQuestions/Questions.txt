1. Did you create the table POSTS in the database? 
if not, who did it for you? Can I change this behavior? (Hint: look at the application.properties file)
A: In application.properties, "posts" table was created automatically by "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update"
This is the feature of Spring Boot, once the SB starts, it scans for @Entity classes.
Because it has Post.java class, it found the Entity and knew to create a Table, name = "posts"




2. Is your id in the database same as what you set in your request? 
why does this happen? (Hint: search the annotations used in your code)
A: No, I cannot mannually set the id for each post data.
Because in Post.java class, in the model of Post, the member id has the annotation "@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)"
Which ensure the id will only be auto-generated by the order of the recorded data.
So even though in my post body, I tried to input:
{
    "id": "200",
    "title": "1231231",
    "description": "Practice post",
    "content": "123213123"
}
The response of the post is:
{
    "id": 3,
    "title": "1231231",
    "description": "Practice post",
    "content": "123213123"
}
