**15. Explain the difference between bean id and bean class.**

1. Bean Class

Definition: The class attribute of a bean defines the Java class that Spring will instantiate.

Purpose: It tells Spring what type of object to create.

2. Bean ID

Definition: The id attribute is the unique identifier for the bean within the Spring container.

Purpose: It lets you reference the bean elsewhere in your configuration or code.

```
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.service.UserService"/>

```

class="com.example.service.UserService" → Spring will create an instance of UserService.

id="myService" → You can now refer to this bean using myService, e.g., for dependency injection:


**16. Explain that when a bean has multiple alternative implementations, how will Spring decide which bean implementation to inject/autowire?**

1. Primary Candidate (@Primary)

If one of the beans is annotated with @Primary, Spring will prefer that bean when multiple candidates exist.

```
@Component
@Primary
public class EnglishGreetingService implements GreetingService { ... }

@Component
public class SpanishGreetingService implements GreetingService { ... }

@Autowired
private GreetingService greetingService; // Injects EnglishGreetingService

Rule: @Primary overrides all other candidates unless explicitly specified with @Qualifier.
```

2. Qualifier (@Qualifier)

@Qualifier can be used to explicitly choose which bean to inject.

```
@Autowired
@Qualifier("spanishGreetingService")
private GreetingService greetingService;

```

3. Bean Name Matching

If no @Primary and no @Qualifier, Spring tries matching by variable name.

```
@Component("englishGreetingService")
public class EnglishGreetingService implements GreetingService { ... }

@Autowired
private GreetingService englishGreetingService; // Name matches bean, so injected

```

4. Fail Fast: No Unique Bean

If Spring cannot decide (no @Primary, no @Qualifier, and multiple beans), it will throw a NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException at runtime.
