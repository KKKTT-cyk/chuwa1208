## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from this class session.
### 1. Controller Annotations
- **`@Controller`**  
  Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller that handles HTTP requests and returns views.
- **`@RestController`**  
  A combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, used to build RESTful web services that return data (e.g., JSON) instead of views.
---
### 2. Request Mapping Annotations
- **`@RequestMapping`**  
  Maps HTTP requests to controller classes or handler methods. Can specify URL paths and HTTP methods.
- **`@GetMapping`**  
  Handles HTTP GET requests.
- **`@PostMapping`**  
  Handles HTTP POST requests.
- **`@PutMapping`**  
  Handles HTTP PUT requests.
- **`@DeleteMapping`**  
  Handles HTTP DELETE requests.
---
### 3. Request Data Binding Annotations
- **`@RequestParam`**  
  Binds query parameters or form data from the request to method parameters.
- **`@PathVariable`**  
  Extracts values from URI path variables.
- **`@RequestBody`**  
  Maps the HTTP request body (usually JSON) to a Java object.
---
### 4. Response Handling Annotations
- **`@ResponseBody`**  
  Writes the method return value directly to the HTTP response body.
- **`@ResponseStatus`**  
  Specifies the HTTP status code returned by a controller method.
---
### 5. Model and Data Binding
- **`@ModelAttribute`**  
  Binds request parameters to a model object and adds it to the model.
---
### 6. Dependency Injection (Related Annotations)
- **`@Autowired`**  
  Automatically injects dependent beans into a Spring-managed component.
- **`@Qualifier`**  
  Specifies which bean to inject when multiple candidates exist.
---
### 7. Validation Annotations
- **`@Valid` / `@Validated`**  
  Triggers validation on request parameters or request body objects.

## 2. Explain tight coupling vs loose coupling and what does Spring IOC do?
### Tight Coupling
Tight coupling means that one class is highly dependent on the concrete implementation of another class.  
In this case, if one class changes, the dependent class often needs to be modified as well.
**Characteristics:**
- Classes directly create or reference other concrete classes
- Hard to change or extend
- Difficult to test (especially unit testing)
- Low flexibility and reusability
**Example:**
```java
class Service {
    private Repository repo = new Repository(); // tightly coupled
}
```
---
### Loose Coupling
Loose coupling means that classes depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
This allows implementations to change without affecting the dependent classes.
**Characteristics:**
- Depends on interfaces or abstractions
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Easier to test (mocking is possible)
- High flexibility and reusability
**Example:**
```java
class Service {
    private Repository repo;

    public Service(Repository repo) {
        this.repo = repo; // loosely coupled
    }
}
```
---
### What Does Spring IoC Do?
Manages object creation and dependency injection to achieve loose coupling.

## 3. What is MVC pattern?
The **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three components:
- **Model**: Handles the business logic and data.
- **View**: Displays the data to the user (UI).
- **Controller**: Handles user requests, processes input, and coordinates between the Model and the View.

## 4. What is Front-Controller?
A **Front Controller** is a design pattern where a **single central controller** handles all incoming requests and then routes them to the appropriate handler or controller.
In **Spring MVC**, the front controller is **`DispatcherServlet`**.
**Responsibilities:**
- Receives all client requests
- Dispatches requests to the correct controller
- Coordinates request handling and response generation

## 5. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works.
**DispatcherServlet** is the **front controller** in Spring MVC.  
It is responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests and coordinating the entire request–response workflow.
### How DispatcherServlet Works
1. **Request Received**  
   The client sends an HTTP request, which is first received by the `DispatcherServlet`.
2. **Handler Mapping**  
   `DispatcherServlet` consults **HandlerMapping** to find the appropriate controller and method that can handle the request.
3. **Controller Execution**  
   The matched controller method is invoked to process the request.
4. **Return Result**  
   The controller returns:
    - a **view name** (in traditional MVC), or
    - **data (JSON/XML)** in REST APIs.
5. **View Resolution (if needed)**  
   If a view name is returned, `DispatcherServlet` uses **ViewResolver** to resolve it into a concrete view (e.g., JSP).
6. **Response Sent**  
   The final response is generated and sent back to the client.

## 6. What is JSP and What is Model And View？
- JSP is a Java-based technology used to create **dynamic web pages**. It allows developers to embed Java code into HTML to generate dynamic content on the server side.
- The **Model** represents the **application data and business logic**.
**Responsibilities:**
- - Stores data (e.g., Java objects, entities)
- - Handles business rules and data processing
- - Provides data to the View
- The **View** is responsible for **displaying data to the user**.
**Responsibilities:**
- - Renders the UI (HTML)
- - Shows data from the Model
- - Does not contain business logic

## 7. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than tomcat
- A **Servlet** is a Java class used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses in a web application.  
  It runs on the server and is part of Java’s web technology stack.
- A **Servlet Container** (also called a web container) is a runtime environment that manages servlets.
### Servlet Implementations (APIs / Specs)
- **Jakarta Servlet (formerly Java Servlet API)**
- **Spring MVC DispatcherServlet** (built on top of the Servlet API)
---
### Servlet Containers (Other Than Tomcat)
- **Jetty** – Lightweight, fast, often used in embedded servers
- **Undertow** – High-performance, non-blocking web server (used by WildFly)
- **GlassFish** – Reference implementation of Java EE / Jakarta EE
- **JBoss / WildFly** – Enterprise-grade application server
- **WebLogic** – Oracle enterprise application server
- **WebSphere** – IBM enterprise application server

## 8. clone this repo, and run it on you local,
### 1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
#### 2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself.
#### 3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
#### 4. remeber to setup mysql database for this project
#### 5. Test APIs (controllers) in postman
