11. What is join() method?
- Used to make the current thread wait until the target thread finishes its execution

12. what is yield() method
- A hint to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to pause and give other threads of the same priority a chance to execute.

13. What is ThreadPool? How many types of ThreadPool? What is the TaskQueue in ThreadPool?
- A ThreadPool is a group of reusable threads that execute submitted tasks, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
- Types: 
- - FixedThreadPool
- - CachedThreadPool
- - SingleThreadExecutor
- - ScheduledThreadPool
- - WorkStealingPool
- The TaskQueue is an internal queue (usually a BlockingQueue) that stores tasks waiting to be executed.

14. Which Library is used to create ThreadPool? Which Interface provide main functions of thread-pool?
- ThreadPool is provided by java.util.concurrent
- Main interfaces:
- - Executor
- - ExecutorService
- - ScheduledExecutorService

15. How to submit a task to ThreadPool?
- Tasks can be submitted using execute() or submit().

16. What is the advantage of ThreadPool?
- Reuse threads
- Improve performance
- Control concurrency
- Reduce resource consumption
- Better task management

17. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor
- shutdown() stops accepting new tasks and waits for existing tasks to finish.
- shutdownNow() attempts to stop all running tasks immediately and returns pending tasks.

18. What is Atomic classes? How many types of Atomic classes? Give me some code example of Atomic classes and its main methods. when to use it?
- Atomic classes provide lock-free, thread-safe operations using CAS (Compare-And-Set).
- Type: 
- - AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicBoolean
- - AtomicReference
- - AtomicArray classes
```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet();
```
- Use Atomic classes when simple shared variables need atomic updates without locks.

19. What is the concurrent collections? Can you list some concurrent data structure (Thread-safe)
- Concurrent collections are thread-safe collections designed for high concurrency.
- Example: ConcurrentHashMap; CopyOnWriteArrayList; BlockingQueue; ConcurrentLinkedQueue

20. What kind of locks do you know? What is the advantage of each lock?
- synchronized: simple, automatic lock release
- ReentrantLock: flexible, supports fairness and tryLock
- ReadWriteLock: better performance for read-heavy scenarios
- StampedLock: supports optimistic read
- Semaphore: controls access to limited resources

21. What is future and completableFuture? List some main methods of ComplertableFuture.
- Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
- CompletableFuture extends Future and supports non-blocking, chainable async operations.
- CompletableFuture Main methods:
- - supplyAsync()
- - thenApply()
- - thenCompose()
- - thenCombine()
- - exceptionally()
- - join()
