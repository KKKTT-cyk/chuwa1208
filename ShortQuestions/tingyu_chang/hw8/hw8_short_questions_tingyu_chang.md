### Q1\. Did you create the table POSTS in the database? if not, who did it for you? Can I change this behavior? (Hint: look at the application.properties file)
1. Did you create the table POSTS in the database? 
* No, the schema was not manually defined via SQL. Instead, the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) provider, specifically Hibernate, automatically generated the table structure upon application startup based on the `@Entity` definitions in the codebase.
2. Can I change this behavior? 
* Yes, this behavior is governed by the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property in the `application.properties` file.
* Currently, it is likely set to `update`, which instructs Hibernate to scan the entities and modify the schema to match. Changing this value to `none` or `validate` is standard practice for production environments to prevent unintended schema modifications, while `create` would drop and regenerate the schema on every restart.

### Q2\.Is your id in the database same as what you set in your request? why does this happen? (Hint: search the annotations used in your code)
* No, the ID persisted in the database differs from the value provided in the request payload.
* Why does this happen? This is due to the `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation applied to the primary key field. 
* This strategy explicitly instructs the persistence layer to delegate ID generation to the underlying database, specifically utilizing the AUTO_INCREMENT feature of MySQL. Consequently, Hibernate ignores any ID passed in the request body and adopts the next sequential value generated by the database engine to ensure primary key uniqueness.
