6. What is JSP and What is Model And View？

JSP (JavaServer Pages)

JSP is a server-side technology in Java used to create dynamic web pages. It allows you to embed Java code directly into HTML to generate content dynamically.

Key Points:

- Runs on a Java EE web server (like Tomcat).

- Typically used for presentation/view layer in web applications.

- Supports embedding Java code, expressions, and custom tags inside HTML.

How it works:

- Client sends HTTP request.

- JSP is compiled into a Servlet by the server.

- Servlet executes Java code and generates HTML.

- HTML is sent back to the client.

So basically, JSP = HTML + Java for dynamic web pages.

Example:

```
<html>
<body>
    <h2>Welcome, <%= request.getParameter("username") %>!</h2>
</body>
</html>

```


Model and View

These are concepts from the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern used in frameworks like Spring MVC.

a. Model

- Represents data and business logic.

- Typically Java objects that carry data between Controller and View.

- Examples: User, Product, Order objects, or a Map<String, Object> containing dynamic values.

b. View

- Represents the presentation layer (what the user sees).

- Can be a JSP, Thymeleaf template, HTML page, etc.

- It only displays data from the Model; it doesn’t process business logic.

c. Controller (for context)

- Handles HTTP requests, interacts with the Model, and returns a View.


7. Explain servlet and servlet container, name some servlet implementations and servlet containers
other than tomcat

What is a Servlet?

A Servlet is a Java class that runs on a server and handles HTTP requests and responses. It’s the backbone of Java web applications. You can think of it as a controller in MVC, sitting between the client (browser) and the server-side logic.

Key Points:

- Written in Java.

- Runs inside a servlet container.

- Handles HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.


What is a Servlet Container?

A Servlet Container (also called Web Container) is a part of a web server that:

- Loads and manages servlets.

- Handles HTTP requests and responses.

- Manages the servlet lifecycle (init → service → destroy).

- Provides services like session management, security, and concurrency.

Think of it as the runtime environment for servlets. Without it, servlets can’t run.


Tomcat is the most famous, but there are many alternatives:

| Servlet Container   | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jetty**           | Lightweight, often embedded in apps, used by Eclipse IDE, Spark Java. |
| **GlassFish**       | Full Java EE server, supports servlets + EJBs + JSF.                  |
| **WildFly (JBoss)** | Enterprise-level, full Jakarta EE support, highly scalable.           |
| **Resin**           | Commercial and open-source, fast and stable.                          |
| **WebLogic**        | Oracle enterprise server, supports Java EE specs.                     |
| **WebSphere**       | IBM enterprise server, heavy-duty for corporate apps.                 |
