5. Explain DispatcherServlet and how it works.

What is DispatcherServlet?

- DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring MVC.

- It’s a Servlet that receives all incoming HTTP requests and delegates them to the appropriate components in the Spring MVC framework.

- Think of it as the traffic cop: it decides which controller, view, or handler should process a request.

The flow is roughly:

```
Client (browser) 
      ↓ HTTP Request
Servlet Container (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)
      ↓ DispatcherServlet
Handler Mapping → Controller → Model
      ↓
View Resolver → View → HTTP Response
      ↑
Back to Client

```

Step by step flow

1. Request comes in

- The servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty) receives the HTTP request.

- The request URL is mapped to DispatcherServlet (configured in web.xml or via Spring Boot auto-configuration).

2. Handler Mapping

- DispatcherServlet asks a HandlerMapping: “Which controller can handle this request?”

- Spring searches for a controller method (annotated with @Controller or @RestController + @RequestMapping/@GetMapping etc.) that matches the request URL and HTTP method.

3. Handler Adapter

- Once the controller is found, DispatcherServlet uses a HandlerAdapter to invoke the method.

- The adapter takes care of calling the method and binding request parameters to method arguments.

4. Controller execution

- The controller executes the business logic and returns a ModelAndView object (or a simple object in case of @RestController).

5. View Resolution

- If it’s a normal @Controller, the ViewResolver is called to figure out which view (JSP, Thymeleaf, HTML) to render.

- If it’s a @RestController, the response is converted to JSON/XML and written to the HTTP response.

6. Response

- DispatcherServlet renders the view or writes the response body and sends it back to the client.
