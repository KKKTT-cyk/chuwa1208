Part 1: Conceptual Questions
Q1. What is the difference between a class and an object? Provide a real-world example.
A: Class is a blueprint, object is an actual instance created from a class.
For example, Car is a class. We can create multiple instances of this class, and each instance can own different values of the Car.


Q2. If you create a parameterized constructor in a class, what happens to the default constructor? What
must you do if you still need it?
A: The default constructor becomes the parameterized constructor unless we define the non-parameter constructor.
If we still need the non-para one, just keep both Class() and Class(x,x,x...)


Q3. What are the four access modifiers in Java? List them from most restrictive to least restrictive.
private -> default -> protected -> public


Q4. Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.
A: overriding modify the parent functions in children classes. overloading is multiple same name function with different type of arguments.


Q5. Can you override a final method? Can you override a private method? Explain why or why not.
A: Both are no. Final is immutable once it has been defined. 
Private method can only be modified in the class that belongs to, if we want to modify, we need to name it protected.

Q6. What is the difference between static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism? When does each occur?
A: Static polymorphism happens in Comile-Time, dynamic polymorphism happens in runtime.

Q7. Why does Java not support multiple inheritance with classes? How can you achieve multiple inheritance in Java?
A: Because it sometimes confused the developers who are responsible to maintain the classes.
We can implement multiple interfaces to achieve the multi-inheritance.

Q8. Consider the following code:
List<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>(); 
Which principle of OOP does this demonstrate? Explain.
A: Polymorphism: List is an interface, ArrayList in a concrete class of the List
