3. What is MVC pattern?

MVC = Model + View + Controller

Model

- Represents application data

- Contains business logic

- Often mapped to database entities

In Spring Boot

- Entity classes (@Entity)

- DTOs

- Service-layer logic

Controller

- Handles HTTP requests

- Coordinates between Model and View

- Decides what response to return

In Spring Boot

- @Controller → returns views (HTML)

- @RestController → returns JSON/XML

View

- Responsible for presentation

- Displays data to users

In Spring Boot

- Thymeleaf (.html)

- JSP (less common now)

- Freemarker

Note: In REST APIs, there is no View — JSON is the response.




4. What is Front-Controller?

The Front Controller is a design pattern commonly used in web applications, including Java Spring, to centralize request handling. Instead of having multiple entry points (like separate servlets or controllers handling different URLs independently), the Front Controller acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

In Spring, DispatcherServlet acts as a front controller. It:

- Receives all incoming HTTP requests.

- Delegates to controllers based on the URL mapping.

- Handles view rendering (like returning JSP, Thymeleaf, JSON, etc.).


```
Client Request → DispatcherServlet (Front Controller)
                 ↓
          HandlerMapping (finds controller)
                 ↓
          Controller (processes request)
                 ↓
          ViewResolver → View (renders response)
                 ↓
             Response back to client

```


Advantages

- Centralized request processing → easier to manage.

- Common tasks (auth, logging, error handling) handled in one place.

- Decouples controllers from repetitive preprocessing logic.

- Simplifies adding cross-cutting concerns (filters, interceptors).
