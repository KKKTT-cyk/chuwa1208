### Q2 - Explain `tight coupling` vs `loose coupling` and what does Spring IOC do?

#### `tight coupling`
A class **directly depends on a concrete implementation** and is responsible for creating its own dependencies<br><br> 
**Characteristics**
1. Uses concrete classes instead of interfaces
2. Dependencies are often created using `new`
3. Changes in one class may require changes in dependent classes
4. Hard to unit test and difficult to maintain

#### `loose coupling`
A class depends on **abstractions (interfaces)** rather than concrete implementations, and dependencies are provided externally<br><br>
**Characteristics**
1. Depends on interfaces instead of concrete classes
2. Implementations can be swapped without modifying the dependent class
3. Easier to test (supports mocking)
4. Better flexibility and maintainability

#### What does Spring IOC do?
The **Spring IoC (Inversion of Control)** container is a core component of the Spring Framework responsible for
- creating and managing objects as beans
- injecting dependencies as **Dependency Injection (DI)**, which automatically writes denpendencies for classes
- enabling loose coupling by wiring dependencies at runtime

---
### Q3 - What is MVC pattern?
The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components to improve maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns<br><br>
Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been included inthe Spring Framework from the very beginning

#### Model
Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC application to another

#### View (Template)
View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data
- In Spring, the most commonly used are JSP or JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library). Other view templates like Thymeleaf, Groovy, Velocity, and FreeMarker etc., can also be plugged in

#### Controller
- The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. They also handle requests and perform marshalling/ unmarshalling
- The function of the controller is to handle a user request, and then place the data in the model
- The controller returns the model (containing data) back to the front controller

---
### Q4 - What is Front-Controller? 
A Front Controller is a design pattern where a single central controller handles all incoming requests in a web application before delegating them to appropriate handlers<br><br>
**In Spring MVC, the Front Controller is `DispatcherServlet`**

---
### Q5 - Explain `DispatcherServlet` and how it works.
`DispatcherServlet` is the front controller in Spring MVC. It handles all incoming HTTP requests and coordinates the request–response workflow

#### How it works
1. Receives the HTTP request from the client
2. Uses HandlerMapping to determine the appropriate controller
3. Invokes the matched controller method
4. The controller processes the request and returns a ModelAndView (model data and view name)
5. DispatcherServlet uses ViewResolver to resolve the view name
6. The view is rendered with the model data
7. The final response is sent back to the client

---
### Q6 - What is JSP and What is Model And View？

#### What is JSP?
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a **server-side view technology** used in Spring MVC to generate dynamic HTML pages
- Used as the View layer in MVC
- Allows embedding Java code and expressions into HTML
- Receives data from the controller through the model
- Rendered on the server and sent to the client as HTML

#### What is Model And View？
`ModelAndView` is an object that contains both the model data and the view name. It is returned by the controller for rendering the response

---
### Q7 - Explain `servlet` and `servlet container` , name some servlet implementations and servlet containers other than `tomcat`

#### `servlet`
A Java class that handles client requests and generates responses in a web application
- Runs on the server side
- Processes HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses
- Follows the Servlet API specification
- Commonly used to implement backend logic in Java web applications
- **`servlet` Implementations**
    - HttpServlet
    - GenericServlet

#### `servlet container`
A runtime environment that manages the lifecycle of servlets
- Loads, initializes, and destroys servlets
- Maps requests to the correct servlet
- Handles threading, security, and request/response objects
- Acts as a bridge between the web server and servlets
- **Examples** (other than `tomcat`):
    - Jetty
    - JBoss / WildFly
    - GlassFish
    - WebLogic
    - WebSphere
