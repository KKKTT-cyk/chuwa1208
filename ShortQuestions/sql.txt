Explain Join in RDBMS/SQL with sample queries.
1. A join combines rows from multiple tables based on a related column.
For example:
SELECT 
    s.student_name,
    d.dept_name,
    sc.school_name
FROM student s
JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id
JOIN school sc ON d.school_id = sc.school_id;

It retrieves each student's name, department name, school name.
From each student, it joins the department table if department id match the student's department id.
From each student, it joins the school table if school id match the student's school id.
