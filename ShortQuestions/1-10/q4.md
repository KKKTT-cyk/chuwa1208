**4. Difference between Runnable and Callable?**

1. Runnable

Key characteristics

- Returns nothing (void)

- Cannot throw checked exceptions

- Introduced in Java 1.0

- Used directly with Thread or ExecutorService


When to use Runnable

- Fire-and-forget tasks

- You don’t care about:

    - return value

    - checked exceptions

- Simple background work (logging, cleanup, metrics)


2. Callable

Key characteristics

- Returns a value

- Can throw checked exceptions

- Introduced in Java 5

- Works with ExecutorService

- Result accessed via Future

When to use Callable

- You need a result

- You need to handle checked exceptions

- Asynchronous computation (DB call, calculation, API call)
