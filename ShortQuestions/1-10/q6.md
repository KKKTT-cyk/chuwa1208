**6. Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?**

Prefer Runnable

Reasons:

- Separation of concerns

    - Runnable = what to do

    - Thread = how to run it

    - This leads to cleaner, more maintainable design.

- Supports inheritance

    - Java allows only single inheritance.

    - If you extend Thread, you cannot extend another class.

    - With Runnable, your class can still extend something else.

- Works naturally with thread pools

    - ExecutorService accepts Runnable (and Callable).

    - Extending Thread does not work with executors.

- Better reusability

    - The same Runnable can be executed by:

        - multiple Threads

        - a thread pool

        - scheduled executors

- Industry standard

    - In real-world Java code, almost no one extends Thread.
