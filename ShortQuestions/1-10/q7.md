**7. What are the thread statuses?**

There six statuses.

1. NEW

Thread is created but not started

- start() has not been called yet

- No OS resources allocated

```
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {});
System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW
```

2. RUNNABLE

Thread is ready to run or currently running

- After calling start()

- Includes:

    - Actually running on CPU

    - Waiting in ready queue for CPU time

```
t.start();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE
```

3. BLOCKED

Waiting to acquire a monitor lock

Happens when:

- Thread tries to enter a synchronized block

- Another thread already holds the lock

```
synchronized(lock) {
    // another thread is blocked here
}

Lock-based waiting only
Not for sleep() or wait()
```

4. WAITING

Waiting indefinitely for another thread’s action

Occurs when calling:

- Object.wait()

- Thread.join()

- LockSupport.park()

```
synchronized(lock) {
    lock.wait(); // WAITING
}

Thread stays here until notified
```

5. TIMED_WAITING

Waiting for a specified time

Occurs when calling:

- Thread.sleep(ms)

- Object.wait(ms)

- Thread.join(ms)

- LockSupport.parkNanos()

```
Thread.sleep(1000); // TIMED_WAITING

Automatically wakes up after time expires
```

6. TERMINATED

Thread execution completed

- run() method exits normally or via exception

```
public void run() {
    // work done
}

// state → TERMINATED
```

Thread Lifecycle

NEW → RUNNABLE → (BLOCKED / WAITING / TIMED_WAITING) → RUNNABLE → TERMINATED
