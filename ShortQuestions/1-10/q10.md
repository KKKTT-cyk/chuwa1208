**10. What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?**

1. Object Lock (Instance Lock)

Every object instance in Java has its own lock (monitor).

Acquired when a thread enters:

- a synchronized instance method, or

- a synchronized(this) or synchronized(obj) block.

Scope

- The lock is tied to one specific object instance.

- Threads accessing different objects do NOT block each other.


Example

```
class Counter {
    synchronized void increment() {
        // object lock
    }
}

```

2. Class Lock (Static Lock)

Every Class object (e.g. Counter.class) has one lock.

Acquired when a thread enters:

- a synchronized static method, or

- a synchronized(ClassName.class) block.

Scope

- The lock is shared across all instances of that class.

- Only one thread in the entire JVM can hold that class lock at a time.


```
class Counter {
    static synchronized void reset() {
        // class lock
    }
}

```

Object Lock vs Class Lock (Summary Table)

| Feature             | Object Lock                     | Class Lock                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Lock belongs to     | Object instance                 | Class object                  |
| Used by             | `synchronized` instance methods | `synchronized static` methods |
| Lock expression     | `this`, `obj`                   | `ClassName.class`             |
| Number of locks     | One per object                  | One per class                 |
| Blocks threads on   | Same object only                | All instances                 |
| Can run in parallel | Yes (different objects)         | No                            |
