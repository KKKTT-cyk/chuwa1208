**What is join() method?**

When a thread calls join() on another thread, the calling thread pauses until the target thread completes.


```
class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
                System.out.println("Worker running: " + i);
                try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            }
        });

        worker.start();

        // Main thread waits for worker to finish
        worker.join();

        System.out.println("Main thread continues");
    }
}

```

This would output:
```
Worker running: 1
Worker running: 2
Worker running: 3
Main thread continues
```

Without join()

"Main thread continues" might run first.
