**12. What is yield() method**

The yield() method in Java is a static method of the Thread class. It is used to pause the currently executing thread and give a chance for other threads of the same priority to execute. Essentially, it’s a way to signal the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU, but it does not guarantee that it will stop running.


Key Points

- Static Method – Called as Thread.yield().

- Hint to Scheduler – It is just a hint; the scheduler may ignore it.

- No Blocking – Unlike sleep() or wait(), it doesn’t block the thread or release any locks.

- Same Priority Threads – It mainly gives a chance for other threads of the same priority to run.

- Doesn’t Affect Thread State Much – The thread remains in the Runnable state, not waiting or blocked.

Think of it like this:

- Before yield(): your thread is actively running and “holding the CPU.”

- After yield(): it voluntarily steps back and becomes just one of the runnable threads in the pool.
