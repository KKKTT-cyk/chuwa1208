**16. What is the advantage of ThreadPool?**


1. Improved Performance (Reduced Thread Creation Overhead)

Creating a new thread for each task is expensive in terms of memory and CPU because thread creation involves allocating stack memory and OS-level thread management.

With a ThreadPool, threads are created once and reused for multiple tasks.

2. Resource Management (Avoids Too Many Threads)

Without a thread pool, if you create hundreds or thousands of threads, you may run into:

High memory usage

CPU thrashing

System instability

ThreadPool limits the maximum number of active threads at any time, preventing resource exhaustion.

3. Better Response Time

For applications with many small tasks (like web servers or message processing systems), a ThreadPool allows immediate execution of tasks by idle threads.

Tasks don’t need to wait for thread creation, so response time improves.

4. Task Queueing

ThreadPool usually comes with a task queue (like BlockingQueue) where incoming tasks wait if all threads are busy.

This ensures no task is lost and allows controlled execution.

5. Easier Management

ThreadPools provide APIs to:

Monitor thread usage

Control thread count dynamically

Schedule recurring tasks (like ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor)

This is much easier than manually managing threads.

6. Supports Scheduled or Periodic Tasks

Using specialized ThreadPools (like ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor), you can execute tasks after a delay or periodically without extra scheduling code.
