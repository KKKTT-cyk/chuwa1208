**15. How to submit a task to ThreadPool?**

There are two ways to submit a task to ThreadPool.

1. execute()

- execute is a method from the Executor interface.

- Accepts a Runnable task.

- Does not return any result or Future.

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit a Runnable task
        pool.execute(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task is running by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        // Shutdown the pool
        pool.shutdown();
    }
}

Nothing will be returned. That's why it doesn't accept callable.
```

2. submit()

- submit is from ExecutorService.

- Can accept Runnable or Callable.

- Returns a Future object, which can be used to get the result or check if the task is done.

Example with Callable:

```
Future<Integer> future = pool.submit(() -> {
    return 42;  // Callable returns a result
});

// Get the result (blocking call)
try {
    Integer result = future.get();
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

```
