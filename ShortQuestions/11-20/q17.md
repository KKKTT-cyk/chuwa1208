**17. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor**


| Feature                     | `shutdown()`                                                            | `shutdownNow()`                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                 | Graceful shutdown                                                       | Immediate shutdown                                                                                               |
| **New task submission**     | No new tasks are accepted                                               | No new tasks are accepted                                                                                        |
| **Already submitted tasks** | Tasks already submitted are **executed** (including those in the queue) | Attempts to **stop all running tasks** and returns the list of tasks waiting in the queue that were not executed |
| **Running threads**         | Running tasks continue to execute until completion                      | Attempts to **interrupt running threads** by calling `Thread.interrupt()` on them                                |
| **Return value**            | Void                                                                    | List<Runnable> of tasks that were waiting but never started                                                      |
| **Use case**                | When you want all submitted tasks to complete before shutdown           | When you want to stop tasks immediately, e.g., in emergency situations                                           |
