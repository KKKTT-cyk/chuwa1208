**13. What is ThreadPool? How many types of ThreadPool? What is the TaskQueue in ThreadPool?**

A ThreadPool is a collection of pre-instantiated reusable threads that are ready to execute tasks.

Key points:

- Instead of creating a new thread every time, tasks are submitted to a ThreadPool.

- Threads pick tasks from a queue and execute them.

- Helps improve performance and manage resources efficiently.

- Reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.



| ThreadPool Type          | Description                                                                                                              | When to Use                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FixedThreadPool**      | Has a fixed number of threads. New tasks wait if all threads are busy.                                                   | When you know the number of threads you need and want controlled concurrency. |
| **CachedThreadPool**     | Creates new threads if none are idle; reuses threads if available. Threads that stay idle for 60 seconds are terminated. | For many short-lived asynchronous tasks.                                      |
| **SingleThreadExecutor** | Only one thread executes tasks sequentially.                                                                             | When you want tasks to run one after another (serialized).                    |
| **ScheduledThreadPool**  | Can schedule tasks to run after a delay or periodically.                                                                 | For recurring tasks like cron jobs.                                           |


TaskQueue in ThreadPool

Definition:
The TaskQueue is a queue where submitted tasks wait until a thread becomes available to execute them.

Key points:

- Each ThreadPool has an associated TaskQueue.

- Types of queues often used:

    - LinkedBlockingQueue – unbounded queue

    - ArrayBlockingQueue – bounded queue

    - SynchronousQueue – no capacity; tasks handed directly to threads

- If a thread is free, it picks a task from the TaskQueue.

- If no thread is free, the task waits in the queue.

- Helps avoid creating too many threads and control memory usage.
