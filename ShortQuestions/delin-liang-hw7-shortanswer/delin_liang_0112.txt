Q1 - Explain Referential Integrity in RDBMS/SQL with sample queries.
Referential Integrity in RDBMS/SQL:
- ensures the accuracy and consistency of relationships between tables
- FOREIGN KEY constraints:
	guarantees that a foreign key in one table (the child table) must 
	always reference a valid, existing primary key (or unique key) in 
	another table (the parent table), or be NULL
- prevents inserting invalid references or deleting parent records that are
 still in use

For example, in the given files:
in TABLE student: FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
inidcates that the Student table is the child table of the Ddepartment table

in this case, a valid insert would be:
INSERT INTO department VALUES (101, 'Computer Science');
INSERT INTO student VALUES (1, 'Alice', 101);

and invalid insert would be:
INSERT INTO student VALUES (2, 'Bob', 999);
because a department with dept_id=999 does not exsist

similarly, doing
DELETE FROM department WHERE dept_id = 101;
is invalid baecause Students still reference dept_id = 101

to get around with it, we need to
FOREIGN KEY (dept_id)
REFERENCES department(dept_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE



Q2 - Explain Join in RDBMS/SQL with sample queries.
Join in RDBMS/SQL:
- combines data from multiple tables
- based on a related column
- used to query relational data

Inner Join:
- returns only rows with matching keys in both tables
- rows without a match in either table are excluded

sample code:
SELECT *
FROM student s
JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id;

sample output:
student_id | student_name | dept_id | dept_id | dept_name
-----------+--------------+---------+---------+-------------
1001       | Alice        | 101     | 101     | CS
1002       | Bob          | 102     | 102     | EE

Left Join:
- returns all rows from the left table
- missing matches from the right table are shown as NULL

sample code:
SELECT s.student_name, d.dept_name
FROM student s
LEFT JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id;

sample output:
student_name | dept_name
-------------+-----------
Alice        | CS
Bob          | EE
Carol        | NULL

Right join:
- returns all rows from the right table
- missing matches from the left table are shown as NULL

sample code:
SELECT s.student_name, d.dept_name
FROM student s
RIGHT JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id;

sample output:
student_name | dept_name
-------------+-----------
Alice        | CS
Bob          | EE
NULL         | Law

Full Join (needs UNION keyword)
- returns all rows from both tables
- includes both matched rows and unmatched rows from either side
- implemented using LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN + UNION

sample code:
SELECT s.student_name, d.dept_name
FROM student s
LEFT JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id
UNION
SELECT s.student_name, d.dept_name
FROM student s
RIGHT JOIN department d ON s.dept_id = d.dept_id;

sample output:
student_name | dept_name
-------------+-----------
Alice        | CS
Bob          | EE
Carol        | NULL
NULL         | Law


=Short Answer==========================
Q1 - Compare Developer API vs User API
Developer API:
- apis designed for developers to integrate systems in applications or fetching data
- Examples: 
	Interfaces & Developer Kits (e.g. JDK): integrate systems
	REST, GraphQL, SOAP: fetch data

User API:
- apis designs for direct access for end users using user interfaces
- supports direct end-user interactions

Q2 - Explain components of REST API?
Resources
- data and entities to be used/consumed

Endpoints
- URIs(URLs) that identify and access the resource

HTTP Methods
- defines actions used on resources
- includes: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

HTTP Status Code
- indicator of thre result of requests
- e.g. 200, 201, 400, 404, 500

Request/Responce
- data exchanged between client and server
- usually represented in JSON files/format


Q3 - Compare each type of HTTP Method
GET
- Purpose: Retrieve representation of data from specified rescource (read-only)
- Has request body: No
- Idempotent: Yes
- Safe (no side effects): Yes
Example: Get a user or list of users

POST
- Purpose: Submit an entity to a specified resource (often result in creation of new resource)
- Has request body: Yes
- Idempotent: No
- Safe (no side effects): No
Example: Create new user

PUT
- Purpose: Update/replace existing resource
- Has request body: Yes
- Idempotent: No
- Safe (no side effects): No
Example: Replace user profile

PATCH
- Purpose: Apply partial modification to a resource
- Has request body: Yes
- Idempotent: Yes (in most case, depends on implementation)
- Safe (no side effects): No
Example: Update user email (only)

DELETE
- Purpose: Remove a specified resource
- Has request body: No (in most cases)
- Idempotent: Yes
- Safe (no side effects): No
Example: Delete user from list


Q4 - Explain authentication field in http header?
Purpose:
- send authentication credentials from client to server

General Syntax:
Authorization: <type> <credentials>
 - <type>: the authentication scheme which indicates the method 
	   used to encode or handle the credentials 
 - <credentials>: the actual token or encoded data

Common Authentication Types:
i) Basic:
- Username and password encoded in Base64
Example: Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==

ii) Bearer Token:
- Most common in REST APIs
- Token-based authentication such as JWT or OAuth access token
Example: Authorization: Bearer <token>

iii) API Keys:
- Simple token-based access mechanism; identifies the application
Example: Authorization: X-API-Key: abcdef12345

Q5 - Explain cookies field in http header?
Purpose:
- store and send small pieces of data between client and server, 
  mainly for session management and user state

Header Names:
- Cookie: sent from client to server
- Set-Cookie: sent from server to client

How it works:
- server sends Set-Cookie in the response
- browser stores the cookie
- browser automatically includes Cookie in future requests to the same domain

Common Uses:
- session identification
- user login state
- user preferences (e.g. language, theme)

Important Attributes:
- Expires/Max-Age: cookie lifetime
- HttpOnly: not accessible by JavaScript
- Secure: sent only over HTTPS
- SameSite: controls cross-site request behavior


Q6 - 
Explain the purpose of http response headers? 
- Provide metadata about the response
- Control client behavior
- Communicate server instructions

Why it is necessary?
- helps maintain state and context across requests
- separates data and control
- ensure correct client behavior
